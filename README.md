# MLB-Game-Engine

## Overview
**MLB Game Engine** is a backend-oriented game simulation engine written in **C++**, designed to model and execute core game logic as a long-running system rather than a graphical application.

This project focuses on **systems engineering**, **real-time simulation**, and **cloud-native architecture**, following principles commonly used in large-scale sports and data-driven platforms.

---

## Project Goals
The main goals of this project are:

- Build a **core game simulation engine** in C++
- Design the engine as a **service**, not a UI-based game
- Prepare the engine for **containerization, orchestration, and cloud deployment**
- Serve as a foundation for future integrations via an API layer

This project is intentionally **incremental** and developed in stages.

---


> The API layer will be introduced in later stages to provide controlled access to the engine.
